Bling Trial test for new posicion process

***Test cases***:
    1) TC_1 --> Sign-Up: Correct sign-up for n=3 users
    2) TC_2 --> Sign-Up: Incorrect sign-up for n=3 users
    3) TC_3 --> Remove user by email: Remove user by email

***Expected results***:
    1) TC_1 --> Response = 200 
    2) TC_2 --> Response = 400
    3) TC_3 --> Response = 204

***Next steps***:
   1) Due to the short time to realize this test i would like to develope in future a pytest
launcher and a report generator. 
   2) From my experience this material helps to the different team mates to solve
successfully and easily the daily job, thus taking adventage of the time to develop other
tasks. 
   3) For a good maintainability of the framework i would like to generate a UML,
in this way we can have a general idea of the different parts of the project.
   4) To conclude, i would like to develope this gitHub project correctly, generating different
branches, to follow a good practices during the project developement.
